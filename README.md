# Teleport - Legacy

Recompiled code of the old single panel Teleport widget.

## Disclaimer

Code is provided as-is and mostly unmodified from the original widget. A better :hover effect was added to match the menu item :hover effects and the `guid` was changed as to not conflict with the modern Teleport widget.

Do not, under any circumstances, bother Una about issues with this widget. Although the code was written entirely by Una - I have taken responsibility and maintaining this code for others to use.

I will accept a PR to add Favorites as it should be possible to backport that code from the modern widget but otherwise I have no intentions of updating the code. The purpose here is to provide it for people who do not know how to compile it for themselves.
